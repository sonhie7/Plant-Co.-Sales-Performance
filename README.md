# Plant Co. Sales Performance Dashboard (2023–2024)

## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Plant Co.’s sales performance across **two years (2023 and 2024)**.

The main objective is to showcase advanced dashboard interactivity, KPI design, and time based performance comparison rather than raw data analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**
- **Power Query** for data transformation
- **DAX** for measures and KPIs
- **Excel** as the original data source

---

## Data Source
The original data was provided in **Excel format** and imported into Power BI.

Data preparation steps included:
- Cleaning and transforming data using Power Query
- Structuring the data model for time intelligence
- Preparing measures for Sales, Quantity, and Gross Profit

---

## Dynamic Metric Selection
A custom table containing three metrics was created:
- Sales
- Quantity
- Gross Profit

This table is used as a **slicer**, allowing all visuals and KPIs in the dashboard to dynamically update based on the selected metric.

This enables flexible analysis without duplicating visuals.

---

## Multi Year Analysis
The dashboard supports analysis for:
- **2023**
- **2024**

A year slicer allows users to switch between years, automatically updating:
- KPIs
- YTD and PYTD values
- Charts and comparisons

---

## KPIs & Performance Indicators
Key performance indicators include:
- YTD (Year-To-Date)
- PYTD (Previous Year-To-Date)
- YTD vs PYTD variance
- Gross Profit Percentage (GP%)

Conditional formatting is applied so that the **YTD vs PYTD KPI changes color when performance is negative**, allowing quick identification of declines.

---

## Dashboard Features
- Bottom performing countries (YTD vs PYTD)
- Monthly YTD vs PYTD analysis
- Quarterly performance by product type
- Profitability segmentation using **GP% vs Value YTD**
- Interactive slicers for year and metric selection


---
## Power BI Skills Demonstrated

- Created **custom DAX measures** for KPIs and calculations  
- Applied **advanced formatting** for a clean and professional dashboard design  
- Used **conditional formatting** to highlight key metrics and performance changes  
- Built **dynamic chart titles** that update based on filters and selections  
- Implemented **dynamic axis titles** for better readability and context  
- Designed **dynamic report titles** that respond to slicers and user interaction  
- Ensured consistent layout, spacing, and color usage for better UX  

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design interactive Power BI dashboards
- Use Power Query for data preparation
- Apply DAX for dynamic measures and KPIs
- Build dashboards focused on business decision making and storytelling

The project emphasizes visualization, interactivity, and usability over raw data exploration.
